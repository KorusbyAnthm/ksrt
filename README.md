# KSRT
...Or **Korus SubRip (Extended)** is a file format extending the SRT (SubRip) file format with anotations and notes as well as support for karaoke.

This project was made as a replacement for LRC (Lyric) files as their structure is a bit clumbersome and less readable. 

## KSRTX combines the best of both worlds.

It combines the general structure of srt files adding on top .lrc-like arguments to subtitle scripts as well as annotations for entonation, karaoke timestamps and notes
